# WebCreation
WebCreation is a project for our Educational project.

This project is created for those users who do not want to write codes or for those users who does not have sufficient knowledge of server side programming language. This project is helpful for those so that they can create website without writing any code and also they can get the whole source code of created website.

After creating website through our site, users can be able to download the created project either the project is static or dynamic. 

Now a days web creation has become a vast and large bransch of computer science for every users, this knowledge is necessary. Every person wants to have their own website so every person wants to become a web developer. But this is not possible to become a good developer so we thought this idea to implement.
